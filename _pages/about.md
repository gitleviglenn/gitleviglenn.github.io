Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [linkname](https://climatekids.nasa.gov/cloud-formation/). Name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your LinkedIn and Google Scholar or just disable all of them.
